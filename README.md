An Android app that helps users keep track of their medications.

Development plan as of February 5, 2021:
Completed:

AddMedication activty - Gives users the ability to add a new medication.
MainActivity - Provides a GUI to view all medications to be taken during the current week. User can mark medications taken or not.

In progress:

Notifications - Push notifications to alter user that it is time to take a medication.

Planned:

MyMedications activity - Displays all medications stored in the database. Allows users to edit, cancel, or delete them, make notes about them, and view statistics about them.
Settings - Make changes to how the app us used, such as how long before the scheduled dose time a medication can be marked as taken.
Improvements to MainActivity - Allow the user to see medications from previous weeks and display only a single patient's medications.
Quantity tracking: Keep track of remaining quantity of a user's prescription and alert them when the quantity drops below a certain level
